[You can say it is 'yet another wiki-framework'. But it will solve my purpose precisely. ](.md)

Everyone needs information related to his work to be readily available. To be on top of everything you always need regular updates from everyone maintaining the integrity and discipline in the whole team. Wiki can hold information but cannot organize it. Wiki is basically for sharing just information. Now collaborative work with information (or process documentation). This project is Wiki + few more things at which wiki is not good at.

Wiki is not good at few instances where you need to:

1. Maintain a definite structure of information.
2. Collaborate with development/support teams.

So this project will help you do all of the above.
